Soulless is a very cool work in progress mod of mine that I have spent quite a lot of time making in concept and now I'm finally coding it!
But this is my first mod so it will take a bunch of time and definetely won't be perfect from a coding perspective
If you want to check out some of the stuff planned for the mod, I made a google doc that I forget to update all the time but on which you can leave comments if you want :)
